Version 0.10 released. Big news this time is that I've added support for the Widcomm stack in Windows XP. This is not well tested and very experimental at this point, so bug reports are appreciated. From the CHANGELOG:
```
    added experimental Broadcom/Widcomm support.  All the basics should be
    supported:
        RFCOMM sockets
        L2CAP sockets
        Device Discovery, Name Lookup
        SDP search on remote devices
        SDP advertisement (RFCOMM, L2CAP)

    Widcomm stack notes:
        1. BluetoothSocket.accept () always returns 0 for the port,
           as the RFCOMM channel/L2CAP PSM of the client device is not exposed
           by the Widcomm API
        2. Not all fields of advertise_service are supported.  The following
           parameters are currently not supported:
               description, protocols
        3. The following methods of BluetoothSocket are not supported:
              gettimeout, dup, makefile, settimeout
        4. The following parameters to discover_devices are not supported:
               duration, flush_cache (cache always flushes)
        5. The timeout parameter of lookup_name is not supported
        6. Once a listening socket has accepted a connection, it is not put
           back into listening mode.  The original listening socket essentially
           becomes useless.
        7. SDP search/browse operations on the local host are not yet supported
```
